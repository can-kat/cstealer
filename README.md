## End of the CStealer

Dear contributors and users,

I’ve made the decision to archive the CStealer repository as I shift my focus toward my education and personal development. This project has been an incredible learning experience for me, and I deeply appreciate all the support, feedback, and contributions from the community over its lifespan.

The repository will remain available in a read-only state for those who might still find it useful, but no further updates or maintenance will be provided.

Thank you all for being part of this journey. I hope to return in the future with new and exciting projects to share!

Wishing you all the best,<br>
cankat.
